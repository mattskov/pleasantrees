Reviews for restrooms. I lived in Queens for a year without a car. I planned my day according to availability of habitable restrooms.

1. Google maps API
- I have no idea how it works
- Searchable database of restrooms by location and rating

2. User generated content
- User can make a personal list, like I used to take an elevator to the PIT Loft on 7th and 29th in NYC.
- Public list developed from voluntarily contributed content
- Reviews and Ratins
- Picture of restroom (? possibly inappropriate and therefore can't be included)
- Real time updates of conditions, ie: clogged, dirty, etc.
- Will need moderation obviously.

3. Restroom owners
- Can "claim" their restrooms and advertise their business on their restroom page.
- Can respond to reviews and update conditions.

4. Possibly transactions, maybe piggybacking off of Podcash.net.
